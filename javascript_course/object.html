    //JSON -- javascript object notation.json is similar to normal javascript object, the only difference is its syntax and limitation. json can't have methon(functionin the object), and it must all use double quote, ie, the key and value. javascript object only makes sense in javascrip while json syntax can be understood by almost all programming  language. so we use json when we want to send data to two computers that might use different programming language. and also when we store data.

    // json bullt in object helps us convert jaascript object to json we use JSON.stingifytoachieve that.

    console.log(JSON.stringify(product2));

    // to do the opposite,we use JSON.parse
    const jsonString = JSON.stringify(product2);
    console.log(JSON.parse(jsonString));

    //local storage is another built in object just like json. It is used to save values more permanently.

    // To save item in local storage
    localStorage.setItem('message', 'hello');

    // To get item from the local storage
    localStorage.getItem('message');
